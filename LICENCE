***NOT YET***
As an exception, when using this program, by means of subclassing and/or
calling individual functions and/or methods, as a library for creating a
game cartridge to be loaded by the Veripeditus game framework, licensors
hereby grant permission to distribute the resulting game cartridge under
licence terms of the game creator’s choice, provided that, for each game
and other module involved in "propagating" them (including the framework
and the Veripeditus server), the terms and conditions of each individual
module are honoured. This effectively means that the game cartridge need
not be distributed under the terms of the AGPL and, explicitly, that the
requirement under AGPLv3 §13 (Remote Network Interaction) to provide the
source code to users does not extend to independent game cartridges made
under the provision of this exception.
