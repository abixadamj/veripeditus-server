 \section{About Veripeditus}

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is Veripeditus?}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item{A free software AR game creation framework}
   \item{Allows easy creation of augmented reality games}
   \item{Run your own server with different worlds and different games in them}
   \item{Play the games using any mobile browser}
  \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Give a short explanation about what Augmented Reality is in the context of Veripeditus.}
  \item{Ask the audience a few questions, like about their experience with AR games, and so on.}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{How it got started}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item{We were looking for a new fun project}
   \item{AR gaming seemed to become popular (cf. that monster catching thingy)}
   \item{We wanted to create something like that without the privacy hassle}
   \item{Many different ideas - why not make it a framework?}
  \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{This is about what we thought when we started the project.}
  \item{Tell a story about how we found Pokémon Go as popular, but non-free, and we wanted our own…}
  \item{Maybe add one or two sentences about privacy being a major issue with popular AR games.}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{New goals after some time}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item{The framework got more and more powerful}
   \item{Developing games with it got much easier than expected}
   \item{So now:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item{Make it as accessible as possible}
     \item{Enable use in various fields besides just-for-fun gaming}
     \item{More about that later!}
    \end{itemize}
   }
  \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Tell a story about how we tried out a lot of things, had many different ideas.}
  \item{Tell a story about how it got more and more abstract, until we decided to make it a framework.}
  \item{Tell a story about how we got many new ideas, and talked to many people, who had a lot of ideas on how and where Veripeditus could be useful.}
  \item{Tell that we will have a look at the various use fields later.}
 }

 \section{How to create games}

 \begin{frame}
  \Large
  Before we discuss more, let's look at how to make a game!
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{This is an interjection so we break lose from just story-telling.}
  \item{The audience should feel that we now show off something.}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic workflow for making a game}

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item{Plan any game objects and their features (position, names, images,…}
   \item{Draft a game plot, activities, other logic}
   \item{Put everything together in object/class definitions in pure Python}
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Tell a bit about every point.}
  \item{Maybe draft a really simple and quick example for every point, but do NOT give away the example that follows!}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A first tiny game}

  {
   \inputminted[linenos,breaklines]{python}{ex_schoolkid.py}
  }
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Tell that this is a simple Python module.}
  \item{Ask the audience to read it and think about it a bit.}
  \item{Give 30 seconds or a minute time.}
  \item{Do not explain the code at this point!}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \Large
  Quiz time: What have we got here?
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Ask the audience to try and explain what the code we showed does.}
  \item{Really motivate them ;)!}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Quiz time: What have we got here?}

  Answers:

  \begin{itemize}
   \item{A Player object with no special behaviour}
   \item{An NPC (non-player character) named AnyChild
    \begin{itemize}
     \item{Spawning at every building tagged a school on OpenStreetMap}
     \item{Having the image of a schoolkid}
     \item{Saying "I can make AR games :)!" when asked}
    \end{itemize}
   }
  \end{itemize}

  Isn't that cool?
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Congratulate the audience for finding out what the game does so well :)!}
  \item{Repeat all facts, amybe adding or correcting everything that might still be missing.}
 }

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{First tiny game, in pictures}

  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{ex_schoolkid_shot2}\hfill
  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{ex_schoolkid_shot3}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Tell a story about the player walking to the location near the school, seeing the NPC, clicking it and then the talk button, and the NPC sending its response.}
  \item{Add a note that of course, any logic involving conditions, and so on might influence the response in a real game!}
 }

 \section{Framework development and design}

 \begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Framework development and design goals}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item{Make game creation as easy and accessible as possible}
   \item{Still allow adding arbitrarily complex code
    \begin{itemize}
     \item{No DSL - game cartridges are plain and honest Python packages}
     \item{Don't get in the way while still being helpful}
    \end{itemize}
   }
   \item{Provide all basic objects and functions to derive from
    \begin{itemize}
     \item{Player, Items, NPCs, Locations, …}
     \item{Dialogues, item management, inventory management, interaction, …}
    \end{itemize}
   }
   \item{Tight and simple integration with OpenStreetMap}
  \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 \note[itemize]{
  \item{Elaborate on the point that the framework offers a lot of abstraction, so using it becomes easy.}
  \item{Elaborate on the point that still, everything is plain Python, and so everything that can be done with Python can be done in a game.}
